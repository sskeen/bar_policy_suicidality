_These studies model contemporary American bodily autonomy reversal (BAR) policymaking, unwinding access to abortion and gender-affirming healthcare, as a structural/systemic time-variant driver of suicidal ideation. Leveraging i.) Transformer-based pretrained LLMs; ii.) interrupted time series and intra-textual causal inference, and iii.) interrogative reflexive thematic analysis, with 1.16M Reddit submissions by BAR-targeted post authors, the collective suicidogenic toll of BAR anticipation and enactment is modeled among cisgender women, transgender, gender-diverse, and all pregnancy-capable Redditors._
