# Passive suicidality in a repressive U.S. political context

***Description:***[^1] Passive suicidal ideation (SI) afflicts 10.6% of the population in pooled epidemiological samples. In contrast to traditional suicidology, critical suicide studies interrogate structural/systemic drivers of disparities in SI, implicating policy-level determinants and stigmatizing political rhetorics. The subdiscipline examines how: 
>“language, discourse, power relations, and social histories….ways of being ‘selves’ and ideas about life, death and suicide are not settled but are always being (re)produced and co-constituted…within specific, social historical, cultural and political contexts.”[^2]

This study models contemporary American bodily autonomy reversal (BAR) policymaking, unwinding access to abortion and gender-affirming healthcare, as a time-variant driver of SI. Leveraging I.) Transformer-based pretrained language models; II.) time series and event study estimation, and III.) reflexive thematic analysis, with ~1M Reddit submissions by BAR-targeted post authors, the collective suicidogenic toll of BAR anticipation and enactment will be modeled among cisgender women, transgender, gender-diverse, and all pregnancy-capable people.
