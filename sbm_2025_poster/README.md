## A GPT-4o-assisted, human-in-the-loop solution for intercoder reliability: guide for behavioral scientists

> _Inter-coder reliability (ICR), often measured via Cohen’s κ, is a hallmark of rigor and trustworthiness in qualitative inquiry. In practice, ICR, even while embracing labor-intensive in-person deliberation and triangulation, can be difficult to attain, rate-limiting the throughput of qualitative investigation. Bridging the strengths and perspectives of AI and human knowledge representations, we demonstrate a novel GPT-4o-assisted technique to achieve substantial–almost perfect ICR transparently, and reproducibly._[^1]
