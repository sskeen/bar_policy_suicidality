## Passive suicidality in a repressive U.S. political context: a triangulated language modeling–policy impact analysis*

> Bodily autonomy reversal (BAR) policies, exemplified by the U.S. Supreme Court’s _Dobbs_ decision overturning abortion access, concurrent with the staggered adoption of state-level gender-affirming care criminalization laws, may represent under-examined drivers of suicidal ideation (SI). Critical-suicidological principles implicate structural/systemic determinants and dehumanizing political rhetorics in SI formation. Grounded in critical suicidology, I leveraged i.) public archival Reddit data ($N$ = 1.16M posts), fine-tuned pretrained RoBERTas ($acc$ = 0.84–0.99, $F_1$ = 0.77–0.85), regex triangulated by few-shot GPT-4o validation functions, ii.) causal inference–econometrics, and iii.) reflexive thematic analysis, to examine BAR policymaking as an SI driver among BAR-targeted Redditors.[^1]
